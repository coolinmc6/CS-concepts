- start with ASCII but convert to alphabet
- Good pseudocode for this project:
  - *get key from command line argument*
  - *turn key into integer*
  - *prompt for plaintext*
  - for each character in the plaintext string
    - if alphabetic
      - preserve case
      - shift plaintext character by key
  - print ciphertext

ASCII -> alphabetical and then alphabetical -> ASCII
