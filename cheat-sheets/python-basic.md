  - CM: great rundown of all the basics. Definitely worth looking at until I get
  more acquainted with Python

# Getting Started

- regular VS Code works just fine
- all files are `.py` extensions
- you can run a python file by doing `python myfile.py` in the terminal
- Python has a ton of really cool libaries that do some cool shit. In the few
hours I've spent in these classes, it's clear that I need to learn not just
some basics in Python but also some basics in the major libraries
