## Innovation and Technology
- Charles Babbage => the idea of a computer, the "analytical engine"
- Ada Lovelace => first programmer
- Alan Turing => formalized concepts of algorithm and computation
- the operating system interfaces with the software we use everyday (and write) TO the hardware
that is the machine
- SDK's (software development kits) are provided by the OS creator to allow developers to build on top of the
operating system
- SDK's have three major parts:
	+ Code
		* Numbers, arithmetic, file systems, user interface, navigation
	+ Language
		* communicates instructions to the computer
	+ Compiler or Interpreter
		* Interpreter: takes the code and then feeds it to the computer as binary (the language that the computer understand) and it does so LIVE
		* Compiler: same as Interpreter except it takes your code, translates to readable machine language,
		and then feeds it to the machine. This allows it to move quicker than Interpreting however if
		something needs to be changed, the code has to be re-compiled

## Computer Communications
- Binary => a system with only two possible states
	+ 1 is On; 0 is Off
- Boolean => true or false
- Bit => single binary state (on or off)
- the binary number system is just 1 and 0
- A grouping of 8 bits is a byte
- Kilobyte: 1024 bytes
- Megabyte: 1024 kilobytes
- Gigabyte: 1024 megabytes
- Terabyte: 1024 gigabytes
- Encoding => taking information that we recognize (i.e. a string, number) and converting it into binary
	+ string -> binary
- Decoding => reconstitutes binary into a value we understand 
	+ binary -> string

## Number Systems
- 1 byte contains 8 bits
- a signed number reserves one bit to identify whether or not the number is positive
- 


## Encoding and Sending Text

## Working with Large Amounts of Data
