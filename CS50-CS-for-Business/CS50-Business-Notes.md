## Computational Thinking

- binary: 0 and 1
- We have typically grown up using the decimal system: 10 possible digits
- 123 => 1 (Hundreds place); 2 (Tens place); 3 (Ones place)
  - 1 * 100 + 2 * 10 + 3 * 1 = 123

Binary:

- 0 => 0
- 1 => 1
- 2 => 10
- 3 => 11
- 4 => 100
- 5 => 101
- transistors are either on or off; they are binary
- so how do we represent letters?
- ASCII => American Standard Code for Information Interchange
- For example, we are going to represent the letter "A" as 65
  - B is 66
  - C is 67
  - etc.
- When we hit A, we are telling the computer to store the number 65 which will be represented in the computer as 0's and 1's
- 72 73 33 => is "HI!" in ASCII
- 72 72 33 => is a color in RGB
- abstraction, where we "don't care" what the lower level complexity really is, we can build off one another and do more and more complex things
- computers only do what they were explicitly told to do
- array is a contiguous section of memory in the computer
- divide and conquer
- trade-offs => you can speed up searches but it **costs** the one-time
price of sorting the array
- linked list => each node just needs to know what the next node is
- It's easy to add new items to the list but NOT easy to search through
- binary search tree actually gives us back logarithmic run time. So if we know that a number is more than a particular node, we can essentially not care about the left half of that node
- hash table looks like a combination of an array and a linked list
- if this was a phone book, you could give each letter it's own key. Each last name that starts with "A" goes into the "A-bucket"
